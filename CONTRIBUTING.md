# Contributing

Contributions really really really are welcome!
If you want to go the extra mile though, there's a few things that'd be appreciated.

If you would like to discuss VRC modding in general, join the [VRChat Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR).
Since this project is not big enough to warrant it's own discord server as of writing.

## PR checklist

It'd be appreciated if you:

- Formatted the code in a way that matches the existing style (4 spaces).
- Split big changes into many small & easy to understand commits

## Getting Github org access

Ping or message @ljoonal.
Access will be given to almost anyone with some track record of modding that is interested in helping out.
